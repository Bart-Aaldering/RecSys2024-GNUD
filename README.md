This is a reproduction of the ACL 2020 paper “Graph Neural News Recommendation with Unsupervised Preference Disentanglement”, made for the RecSys Challenge 2024.
We have forked the authors' code and tried to use it. Because we use a different dataset, we adapted the dataloader and made a lot of changes, the new dataloader can be found in `data_loader_ebnerd.py`. We also wrote a new `main.py`. Bram, can you add what other changes we made?
